ThoFeOne is a Python module for the caclulation of the one-dimensional self-
consistent quantum-Poisson problem in the Thomas-Fermi approximation. It also
includes analytical equations for coparing the simultor results. It can be 
used to calculate the electronic densities in two-dimensional electron gases 
at heterostructures of GaAs-based devices.

This includes AlGaAs/GaAs of different alloy concentrations, or other materials
used for 2DEGs in heterostructures and different doping densities. 

The calculation of the density of states is done using the effective mass appro-
ximation.Only the effective mass and relative dielectric constants are required 
for the solution of the problem. The doping density is also given as parameter, 
as well as the voltage at the gate (top and/or bottom).

The analytical model includes various cases of the same structure (which is also
given as an example for the 1D simulator). The cases are with/without the quantum
capacitance, with/without the quantum term (Poisson only) etc.
