Development version for varying mesh spacing and Hamiltonian discretization 
constant.

ThoFeOne is a free (open source) Python package for the solution of the 
one-dimensional self-consistent quantum-Poisson problem in the Thomas-Fermi
approximation. It is written in Python and can be used to calculate the
electronic densities in two-dimensional electron gases at heterostructures 
of GaAs-based devices, independent of the materials that incorporate.

This includes AlGaAs/GaAs of different alloy concentrations and doping densities.

The calculation includes the self-consistent part, where the electron density is
performed in the Thomas-Fermi approximation using the Integrated Density of States,
and an analytical part which includes different approximations in order to compare
with the simulation.
